# Employee Management System 

Uses OOP principles (such as encapsulation, and inheritance), along with open hashing with Arraylist buckets to build modular Employee and Hashtable Classes. 

Includes CRUD operations and file I/O via Buffered Reader. 

Search engine is designed in constant time for ID/name/location queries. Supports multi-category searching with dynamic Swing UI components using Java Swing. 

Future Update: Improving graphics using HTML and CSS. 

Inspired by the WorkDay platform which I used for work.
