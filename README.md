# Employee Management System 

Uses OOP principles (such as encapsulation, and inheritance), along with open hashing with Arraylist buckets to build modular Employee and Hashtable Classes. 

Includes CRUD operations and file I/O via Buffered Reader. 

Search engine is designed in constant time for ID/name/location queries. Supports multi-category searching with dynamic Swing UI components using Java Swing. 

**Note:** the main features can be found in the file titled "HomeScreen.java"

Future Update: Improving graphics using HTML and CSS. 

Please note that inorder to load data from the file, employee data has to be first added, and **saved using the save button**. No sample data is provided. 

Inspired by the WorkDay platform which I used for work.
